# BlockBreaker-BlockPlacer

# What is BB-BP?

This is a block breaker / block placer plugin for minecraft 1.18.2 (tested version!!) (50/50 works on all versions)

I spent alot of time on this plugin so I hope you enjoy!

# How to use
1. Place a dispenser
2. Run the the command (/bb or /blockbreaker OR /bp or /blockplacer)
3. Make sure it has a pickaxe or block in the dispenser (depending on what command you use)
4. Power it with redstone
5. Enjoy!!

# Issues

- Doesn't check what world the bb or bp is in
- Doesnt remove broken bb or bp
- Doesn't check if it is already a bb or bp (might leave this in!)
- Doesn't effect tool durability
- Doesn't clone what enchments are on the tool (Will come soon)
- If there is 1 block in the placer then it wont remove it (WHYY?? I dont know!)


# Planed features
